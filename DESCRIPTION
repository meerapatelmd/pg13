Description: Functionalized rendering, reading, and building SQL statements in the
    PostgreSQL dialect using R. Other functions from the DatabaseConnector package are 
    migrated here with additional conditional steps, such as giving an optional warning 
    if the resultset has 0 rows, verbosity such that it is interactively known what 
    operations are taking place, or SQL rendering in the console before the statement is 
    sent and/or queried for troubleshooting in separate client.
