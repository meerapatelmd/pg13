Description: Functionalized rendering, reading, and building SQL
    statements in the PostgreSQL dialect using R. Other functions from the
    DatabaseConnector package are migrated here with additional
    conditional steps, such as giving an optional warning if the resultset
    has 0 rows, verbosity such that it is interactively known what
    operations are taking place, or SQL rendering in the console before
    the statement is sent and/or queried for troubleshooting in separate
    client.
