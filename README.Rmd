Functionalized rendering, reading, and building of PostgreSQL statements using R. 
Other functions from the DatabaseConnector package are migrated here with added 
conditional steps, such as warning the user that a resultset has 0 rows, verbosity 
such that it is interactively known what operations are taking place, or SQL 
rendering in the console before the statement is sent and/or queried for 
troubleshooting in a separate client.  

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("meerapatelmd/pg13")
```

## Example  

pg13 provides functions that simplifies queries such as joins from the R console. 

First, a connection is made to Postgres. Here, I am connecting to my test database `pg13_test`. 

```{r}
library(pg13)
conn <- local_connect(dbname = "pg13_test")
```

```{r example_setup, include=FALSE}
create_test_schema <-
        function(conn) {

                if (!schema_exists(conn = conn,
                                   schema = "test_schema")) {

                        create_schema(conn = conn,
                                      schema = "test_schema")

                }
        }
create_test_schema(conn = conn)

# Write a table to join to without dropping
write_table(conn = conn,
            schema = "test_schema",
            table_name = "test_table2",
            drop_existing = TRUE,
            data = data.frame(A = 1:25, B = letters[1:25]))
```

I write a target table in the test database with sample data: 

```{r}
test_table <- data.frame(A = 1:25, B = letters[1:25])
head(test_table)
```

The data is written to the target `schema` and `table_name` or "test_schema" and "test_table2" respectively. 

```{r}
write_table(conn = conn,
            schema = "test_schema",
            table_name = "test_table2",
            drop_existing = TRUE,
            data = data.frame(A = 1:25, B = letters[1:25]))
```

I create another dataframe in the R environment to serve as left-side table for this demonstration.  

```{r}
test_data <-
        data.frame(A = 1:100, B = letters[1:100])
head(test_data)
```

I can then perform various joins between this dataframe and the previously written table, such as an inner join 

```{r}
join1(conn = conn,
      write_schema = "public",
      data = test_data,
      column = "A",
      kind = "INNER",
      join_on_schema = "test_schema",
      join_on_table = "test_table2",
      join_on_column = "A")
```

a right join

```{r}
join1(conn = conn,
      write_schema = "public",
      data = test_data,
      column = "A",
      kind = "RIGHT",
      join_on_schema = "test_schema",
      join_on_table = "test_table2",
      join_on_column = "A")

```

a left join 

```{r}
join1(conn = conn,
      write_schema = "public",
      data = test_data,
      column = "A",
      kind = "LEFT",
      join_on_schema = "test_schema",
      join_on_table = "test_table2",
      join_on_column = "A")
```

or a full join:  

```{r}
join1(conn = conn,
      write_schema = "public",
      data = test_data,
      column = "A",
      kind = "FULL",
      join_on_schema = "test_schema",
      join_on_table = "test_table2",
      join_on_column = "A")
```

```{r, include=FALSE,eval=TRUE,results='hide'}
drop_schema(conn = conn,
            schema = "test_schema",
            cascade = TRUE)

dc(conn = conn)
```
