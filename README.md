# pg13 R Package     

Functionalized rendering, reading, and building SQL statements in the
PostgreSQL dialect using R. Other functions from the DatabaseConnector package are 
migrated here with additional conditional steps, such as giving an optional warning 
if the resultset has 0 rows, verbosity such that it is interactively known what 
operations are taking place, or SQL rendering in the console before the statement is 
sent and/or queried for troubleshooting in separate client.
